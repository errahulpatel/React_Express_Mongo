# Organic Backend Task
The applications that we build generally use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS) stack to build an API for a basic CMS. 
The API should have CRUD endpoints for Pages and Users schemas.

We have two sub projects in this project. Please go through README files for both of the sub projects and install necessary dependencies. 

## backend

backend consists MongoDB and Express. 

## frontend

frontend consists React and it is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

# Note
Please install Node and NPM first to run this project.
