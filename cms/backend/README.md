# Getting Started with ExpressJs with Mongoose and JSON Web Tokens

This project was developed using ExpressJs with mongoose.

Express: A web application framework for Node.js.

JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between client and sever using public/private key pairs.

MongoDB: A document-based open source database.

### Connection with MongoDB
We have hosted our database in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas and youâ€™ll get a connection string from .env file. Open [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas] for more info. 

You can use this connection string to connect DB from MongoDBCompass. Open [https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass] for more info about compass. 


## Developments

In the project directory, you can run first below command to install npm dependencies

### 'npm install'

To run Express server, we need to install below npm command, Which will install all the necessary packages to make the project runnable.

### 'npm install -g nodemon'

Now we can the server by using nodemon:

### 'nodemon index'

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
